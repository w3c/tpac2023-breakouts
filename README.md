# TPAC 2023 - Breakout sessions
This repo is for the W3C community to propose and organize breakout sessions for [TPAC 2023](https://www.w3.org/2023/09/TPAC/). Sessions will take place on Wednesday, 13 September; detailed schedule will be based on the proposals received and published on the [TPAC schedule](https://www.w3.org/2023/09/TPAC/schedule.html#wednesday) a couple of days before that.
